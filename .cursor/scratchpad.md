# NFC Wallet Selection Feature Implementation

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to add wallet selection functionality to the NFC wallet handshake app. Currently, when an ethereum: URI is sent via NFC, the system shows an app picker each time. The goal is to:
1. Ask user to select a preferred wallet on app load ✅
2. Save the chosen wallet preference ✅
3. Send intents directly to the chosen wallet app instead of showing picker ✅
4. **UPDATED**: Use the user's wallet address as the payload instead of hardcoded address ✅

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to detect available wallet apps that can handle ethereum: URIs ✅
- Implement persistent storage for wallet preference using SharedPreferences ✅
- Modify CardService to use selected wallet instead of generic intent ✅
- Handle cases where selected wallet is uninstalled or unavailable ✅
- **NEW**: Add wallet address input and storage ✅
- **NEW**: Use stored wallet address as NFC payload ✅
